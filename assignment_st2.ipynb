    "# The mean, median, and mode are all measures of central tendency used to describe the \"typical\" or central value of a dataset. However, they differ \n",

    "# 1. Mean: The mean is calculated by adding up all the values in a dataset and dividing the sum by the number of values. It is also known as the \n",

    "#a symmetrical distribution and there are no significant outliers.\n",
    "\n",

    "#number of values, the median is the middle one. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. \n",

    "#skewed distributions or when the presence of outliers can skew the results.\n",

    "# 3. Mode: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. Unlike the mean and median, the mode does not require numeric data. \n",
    "#A dataset can have one mode (unimodal) or multiple modes (multimodal) if there are multiple values with the same highest frequency. The mode is \n",
