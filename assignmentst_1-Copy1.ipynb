    "# Statistics can be broadly categorized into two main types: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. Let's explore each type and provide \n",
    "#examples of when they might be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Descriptive Statistics:\n",
    "# Descriptive statistics involves summarizing and describing the main features of a dataset. It provides insights into the data's characteristics, \n",
    "#such as central tendency, dispersion, and shape. Some common descriptive statistics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "# - Measures of Central Tendency: These statistics describe the typical or central value of a dataset. Examples include the mean, median, and mode. \n",
    "#For instance, the mean can be used to determine the average income of a group of individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - Measures of Dispersion: These statistics quantify the spread or variability of the data. Examples include the range, variance, and standard \n",
    "#deviation. For instance, the standard deviation can be used to understand the variability of test scores in a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - Frequency Distributions: These statistics present the number of occurrences of different values or categories in a dataset. They are often \n",
    "#represented as histograms or bar charts. For example, a frequency distribution can be used to show the distribution of ages in a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Descriptive statistics are useful for organizing and summarizing data, enabling researchers to gain initial insights and understand the basic \n",
    "#properties of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Inferential Statistics:\n",
    "# Inferential statistics involves making inferences and drawing conclusions about a population based on a sample of data. It uses probability theory \n",
    "#and sampling techniques to generalize findings from the sample to the entire population. Some common inferential statistical techniques include:\n",
    "\n",
    "# - Hypothesis Testing: This technique is used to make decisions or draw conclusions about a population based on sample data. For example, \n",
    "#a researcher might use hypothesis testing to determine whether a new drug is effective by comparing its effects on a treatment group to a control \n",
    "#group.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - Confidence Intervals: Confidence intervals estimate the range within which the true population parameter is likely to fall. For instance, \n",
    "#a poll might report a 95% confidence interval for the percentage of voters supporting a particular candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - Regression Analysis: Regression analysis examines the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable.\n",
    "#It can be used to make predictions or understand the impact of different factors. For example, regression analysis can be used to determine how \n",
    "#advertising expenditure influences sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inferential statistics help researchers make broader conclusions and predictions about populations beyond the data they have collected. \n",
    "#They provide a way to test hypotheses, make generalizations, and make informed decisions based on the available evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "# It's important to note that these two types of statistics are interrelated and often used together in the research and analysis process. \n",
    "#Descriptive statistics lay the foundation for understanding the data, while inferential statistics enable researchers to make broader inferences \n",
    "#and draw conclusions."

    "# 3. Interval Data: Interval data has numerical values with equal intervals between them, but it does not have a true zero point. \n",
