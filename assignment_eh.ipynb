    "#In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. \n",
    "#When an exception occurs, the program's normal execution is immediately halted, and the control is transferred to a specific block of code \n",
    "#known as an exception handler. The exception handler catches and handles the exception, allowing the program to gracefully handle errors and \n",
    "#take appropriate actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Exceptions in Python can occur for various reasons, such as when a program encounters an error, performs an illegal operation,\n",
    "#or encounters an unexpected condition. Some common types of exceptions in Python include TypeError, ValueError, FileNotFoundError, \n",
    "#and ZeroDivisionError, among others. Python also allows you to define your own custom exceptions by creating new classes that inherit \n",
    "#from the base Exception class or its subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#On the other hand, syntax errors are different from exceptions. Syntax errors occur when the Python interpreter encounters code that \n",
    "#violates the language's syntax rules. These errors prevent the program from running at all since the code cannot be parsed correctly.\n",
    "#Syntax errors typically include mistakes such as misspelled keywords, missing or misplaced punctuation, incorrect indentation, or improper use \n",
    "#of operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Unlike exceptions, which can occur during runtime, syntax errors are identified during the parsing or compilation phase of the program before\n",
    "#it is executed. When a syntax error is encountered, the interpreter raises a SyntaxError exception and provides information about the error, \n",
    "#including the specific line number and the nature of the problem."
