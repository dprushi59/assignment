    "#The modes available for opening a file in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "#'r' (Read mode): This is the default mode for opening a file. It allows you to read the contents of an existing file.\n",
    "#If the file does not exist, an error will occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "#'w' (Write mode): This mode allows you to write new data to a file. If the file already exists, \n",
    "#it will be truncated (i.e., the existing contents will be deleted) before writing the new data. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "#'a' (Append mode): This mode allows you to append new data to the end of an existing file. \n",
    "#If the file does not exist, a new file will be created. Unlike the write mode, the existing contents of the file will not be deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "#'x' (Exclusive creation mode): This mode is used to create a new file. \n",
    "#If the file already exists, an error will be raised.\n",

    "#'t' (Text mode): This is the default mode for opening a file in text format. It is used to read or write text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#'b' (Binary mode): This mode is used to read or write binary data, such as images or non-text files. \n",
    "#It is commonly used with modes 'rb' (read binary) and 'wb' (write binary).\n",
    "\n",
    "#'+' (Read and write mode): This mode allows you to read and write to a file simultaneously. \n",

    "#Release of system resources: When you open a file, the operating system allocates certain resources to handle the file, \n",
    "#such as memory and file descriptors. These resources are limited, and if you don't close the file properly, \n",
    "#they may not be released, leading to resource leakage. By closing the file, you free up these resources, \n",

    "#Closing the file ensures that any pending data in the buffer is flushed and written to the file. \n",
    "#If you don't close the file properly, the buffered data may not be written, and you might lose unsaved changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Prevent data corruption: Closing a file ensures that all internal data structures associated with the file are properly cleaned up. \n",
    "#If you terminate your program without closing the file, it may lead to data corruption or incomplete writes,\n",
    "#which can result in file inconsistencies or errors when you try to access the file later.\n",
